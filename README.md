See 0:03 2:01 2:33 3:20 3:42 6:58 7:12 - My best parts...

Here are some links that I found:

http://www.anf.nildram.co.uk/beebcontrol/arms/mentor/index.html

But I couldn't find any technical information about it...
So I decided to reverse engineer the robot and its controller
to figure out how can I run it with Arduino...

All the technical information (that I managed to recover by many testing),
The software, and some pictures are at this link:

Total of 3 working days..! And it's worth it..!!


Enjoy :)
